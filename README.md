# UGAReport

Opinionated LaTeX template for UGA Reports.

You can check the final result on the [example document](https://github.com/servinagrero/UGAReport/blob/master/example.pdf).

## Usage

- Clone the repository
- Add `documentclass{UGA_Report}` at the beginning of the document.
- You can copy the `template.tex` as a starting point.
- Optionally use the provided `.latexmkrc` file to build the file.

## WIP

This template is in an early stage and is in need of more work to allow for more customization.

## Inspiration

I have based this template on the work of [tairosonloa](https://github.com/tairosonloa/UC3M_LaTeX_template) and [Pseudomanifold](https://github.com/Pseudomanifold/latex-mimosis).
